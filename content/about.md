title: what is this?
---

arcanequotes.com is a completely overengineered site that I build soley for learning purposes and to run experiments on. All the site really does is to let you search for quotes from the [series arcane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_(TV_series)). What makes it interesting is how I build it, which I share with you, dear reader, in the articles on this site. \
Not sure where to start? Here are some ideas:

- Architecture overview 
- Monitoring
- Database
